The main function of this project is in the a_star file, so if you run the code, you need to go to a_star to execute the run. 
If you need to view different heuristic functions and set different map environment properties, please move to the lower part of this function and make changes. 
If you change the moving area, go to the point file to make changes.

2.
Please note that the python version used by the source code is 3.7, so when downloading special libraries referenced by some programs, please use python3 or above.
